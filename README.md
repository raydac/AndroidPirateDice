# Introduction
In my childhood I very liked to play in the Pirates board game ([published in the Pioner magazine #6 1989](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxHnNp97IgMRem0yUWNwTzEyVVk&authuser=0)), it is great game developed by russian game designer and artist [Vladimir Golytsyn](http://prodesign.ru/game/piraty/vmg_4.htm) in 1934.

# The Board game rules
[I made some English translation of the original Russian article.](https://github.com/raydac/AndroidPirateDice/blob/master/Docs/BoardGameReferenceEng.pdf)

# The Game dice
The Main problem for the game is that the game needs special dice to play

My friend made such device for our games but at present we have nice smartphones and I decided to make Android version of such dice.
# How to install?
The Android application is compatible with Android 2.1+.

# How to change the dice layout?
To change the dice layout to PRO or REDESIGNED versions is very easy, just open the menu of the application and select 'Pro' item. Every layout change, the menu item will be changing its name to the next layout identifier.
