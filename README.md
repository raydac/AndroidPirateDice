# The Board game rules
[I made some English translation of the original Russian article.](https://github.com/raydac/AndroidPirateDice/blob/master/Docs/BoardGameReferenceEng.pdf)

# The Game dice
The Main problem for the game is that the game needs special dice to play

My friend made such device for our games but at present we have nice smartphones and I decided to make Android version of such dice.
# How to install?
The Android application is compatible with Android 2.1+.
