# Introduction

In my childhood, my friends and I spent a lot of time to play the Pirates board game ([published in the Pioner magazine #6 1989](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxHnNp97IgMRem0yUWNwTzEyVVk&authuser=0)), it was a great game developed by the russian artist [Vladimir Golytsyn](http://prodesign.ru/game/piraty/vmg_4.htm) in 1934.

# The Game dice
The Pirate game needs a special dice which was expected to be made manually.

One my friend made one from an old can, but today it's too old-fashioned way.

# How to change the dice layout?
To change the dice layout to PRO or REDESIGNED versions is very easy, just open the menu of the application and select 'Pro' item. Every layout change, the menu item will be changing its name to the next layout identifier.
